#The Brain Machine

This is a simple application to be used with a smart phone and [Google Cardboard.](https://store.google.com/product/google_cardboard?utm_source=en-ha-na-us-sem&utm_medium=desktop&utm_content=plas&utm_campaign=Cardboard&gl=us&gclid=Cj0KEQjwh428BRCnvcyI-5nqjY4BEiQAijebwtnYoOtdMiAJhkIG7UCkNxR9WNJE_Yu9eNO8GhD2YA4aAieC8P8HAQ)

The application is intended to induce altered states of consciousness similar to
meditative states by using visual and acoustic frequencies and a technique called [brainwave entrainment.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainwave_entrainment) I modeled this app off of the
Adafruit Brain Machine. More information can be found [here.](https://www.adafruit.com/product/287)

**This application uses flashing lights and sounds. Do not use if you are prone to or worried
about seizures.**
